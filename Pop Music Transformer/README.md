# Pop Music Transformer

In order to finetune model, you have to create a directory `checkpoint`, downloading pretrained checkpoint provided by REMI's author ([1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fheWv6BJaoXZ98XljaCMsLIdFWglbj8s/view?usp=sharing), [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Al3mxUFwFyW3260K6VDK2c24WZbAVe5/view?usp=sharing)) or my checkpoint which I finetune model on Jay Chou's Music ([1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ElvaRPYE-6UO4711leQoaMl6it0gJvo2/view?usp=sharing), [2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HC8LbLqMn6I8Ney_Q3lR65HdQMNd2HXC/view?usp=sharing)) and put them in `checkpoint` directory.

The easist way to run this project is uploading the project to google drive, and running `main.py` in colab.
